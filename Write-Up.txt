THOUGHT PROCESS

Since it is not useful to simply look at the prices and price histories of two stocks,
we need need something more useful.

That something can be the tracking of the ratios between two correlated stocks.

We can do this by modifying the already existing graph component we had created in the previous step
to better fit what we are trying to do (track pair stock ratios).

Here we modify:
- the graph schema (what data we want to work with)
- the graph itself (what we want to show on the graph)
- the function that updates the graph (for real time analysis)

But to make sure that we recieve the correct data, we need to update our DataManipulator function
(what our graph update function relies on)

We need:
- The ratio between stock A and stock B
- the upper and lower bounds (where we want our triggers to be)

With these changes, we are now able to track the ratios between two given stocks and be alerted when
the ratios break either our upper or lower bounds (adjustable)

INSIGHTS FOR TRADERS:
Given two historically correlated stocks, the ratios between the stocks is 1 (on average). But when
the ratios between the stocks deviate from that average (set by the upper and lower bounds), there 
is a possible trade opportunity (alert is triggered). With alerts in place to indicate these
opportunities, a trader can look at other factors (on top of the alert) to decide whether or not to
take a trade.
